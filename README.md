Problem Statement: DVT Project
Business Context:
Accidents occur worldwide due to various factors such as negligent driving, adverse climatic conditions, and infrastructure issues. These incidents lead to a significant number of insurance claims, posing a challenge for insurance companies. Accurately estimating the number of accidents and subsequent claims is crucial for the sustainability and profitability of the business. By analyzing the claims data, insurance companies can anticipate future claims, optimize their financial reserves, and develop innovative policies.

Understanding the patterns and trends in claims data is equally essential. Insights derived from such analysis enable companies to offer tailored insurance policies that provide better benefits to users while optimizing premium rates. This balance ensures customer satisfaction and maximizes the company’s profitability. Additionally, analyzing claims data can help in identifying fraud, improving customer segmentation, and creating dynamic pricing models based on risk profiles.

 

Objective:
As a Lead Data Analyst at an Insurance Claims company, you are tasked with leveraging data to gain actionable insights from the Car Insurance Claims dataset. Your primary objective is to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and present your findings through an interactive and visually appealing storyboard.

The project involves the following key deliverables:

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to uncover trends and anomalies.
Use various visualizations to showcase relationships between features such as accident frequency, claim amounts, and policy types.
Insight Development:

Interpret findings to provide meaningful insights that highlight key patterns in claims data.
Identify factors contributing to higher claim rates and propose strategies to mitigate risks.
Interactive Storyboard Creation:

Develop a minimum of five dashboards (excluding summary and insights dashboards) that present different aspects of the claims data.
Ensure these dashboards are interactive, user-friendly, and visually consistent.
Summary and Recommendations Dashboard:

Create a summary dashboard that encapsulates the key insights and provides actionable recommendations.
This dashboard will serve as a quick reference for Senior Management to make data-driven decisions.
Final Presentation to Senior Management:

Present a cohesive narrative through your storyboard, demonstrating how the insights align with business objectives.
Highlight actionable recommendations to improve the claims process, optimize premium strategies, and enhance customer experience.
By completing this project, you will enable Senior Management to make informed, data-driven actions to refine their claims system, improve policy offerings, and strengthen the company’s market position.

 

Key Questions to be Answered (for EDA):
Explore variables in the data individually and the relationship between the variables in the data to answer the following questions:

What is the distribution of car owners' ages (using the 'BIRTH' variable)? Are there any outliers or notable trends in the age distribution?
How does the average income ('INCOME') of drivers vary based on their education level ('EDUCATION')? Are there any specific education levels that tend to correlate with higher incomes?
Is there a relationship between the age of the car ('CAR_AGE') and the frequency of claims ('CLM_FREQ')? Does the age of the car influence the likelihood of claims being filed?
Are there any differences in the distribution of claimed amounts ('CLM_AMT') between drivers who use their cars for different purposes ('CAR_USE')? How does this difference compare between gender ('GENDER') groups as well?
Does the type of car ('CAR_TYPE') have an impact on the average worth of the car ('BLUEBOOK')? Additionally, can you identify any patterns in terms of marital status ('MSTATUS') and car type ('CAR_TYPE') combinations?
